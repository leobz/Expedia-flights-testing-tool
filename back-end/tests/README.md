## How do I get started?

First, you need to install byexample (byexample is a literate programming engine where you mix ordinary text and snippets of code in the same file and then you execute them as regression tests. More information https://github.com/byexamples/byexample)

```
$ pip install byexample
```

If you don't have ``pip`` or ``python`` installed, check the
[download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## Run Tests

In this directory:
```
$ rake test
```
